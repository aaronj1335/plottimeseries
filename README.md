# Time series plotting app and CLI tool

Generated with Google's Antigravity.

DESIGN.md was mostly generated from an initial simple prompt:

> Create a README.md to design a node.js project that plots time series data from csv input. Use React for all UI, d3.js for all visualizations. Provide a hot-reloading development server that plots csv data from a local development directory in this repository, and provide a single file javascript utility that can be run via node.js that can take a csv file as input and generate the same output as the development server.
